# dotfiles

[sloria's dotfiles](https://github.com/sloria/dotfiles-old), rewritten as Ansible roles. Sets up a full local development environment with a **single command.**

**As of 2025, this repo only supports macOS.** There's still remnants of Red Hat and Debian support, but they are not maintained.

## a few neat features

- zsh configured with [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto).
- nice fonts for the terminal and coding.
- python managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- vim with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for plugin management. All configuration in a single file [.vimrc](https://github.com/sloria/dotfiles/blob/master/roles/vim/files/vimrc).
- pluggable. Everything is optional. Fork this. Remove what you don't use. Configure what you do use.
- Mac packages installed with [homebrew][]. Mac apps installed with [homebrew cask][] and [mas][].
- Useful git aliases

## prerequisites

- homebrew (If on macOS) - **Install this first**
- git: `brew install git`
- ansible >= 1.6: `brew install ansible`

## install

- [Fork](https://github.com/sloria/dotfiles/fork) this repo.
- Clone your fork.

```bash
# Replace git url with your fork
# NOTE: It is important that you clone to ~/dotfiles
git clone https://github.com/YOU/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
```

- Update the following variables in `group_vars/local` (at a minimum)
  - `full_name`: Your name, which will be attached to commit messages, e.g. "Steven Loria"
  - `git_user`: Your Github username.
  - `git_email`: Your git email address.
- Optional, but recommended: Update `group_vars/local` with the programs you want installed by [homebrew][], [homebrew-cask][], and npm.
  - `mac_homebrew_packages`: Utilities that don't get installed by the roles.
  - `mac_cask_packages`: Mac Apps you want installed with [homebrew-cask][].
- Edit `local_env.yml` as you see fit. Remove any roles you don't use. Edit roles that you do use.
- Run the installation script.

```bash
./bin/dot-bootstrap
```

## authenticating with github

You won't be able to push to repos until you authenticate with GitHub.
You can use `gh` for this, which should have been installed by `dot-bootstrap` above.

```
gh auth login
```

## updating your local environment

Once you have the dotfiles installed you can run the following command to rerun the ansible playbook:

```bash
dot-update
```

You can optionally pass role names

```bash
dot-update git python
```

## updating your dotfiles repo

To keep your fork up to date with the `sloria` fork:

```
git remote add sloria https://github.com/sloria/dotfiles.git
git pull sloria master
```

## commands

There are three main commands in the `bin` directory for setting up and updating development environments:

- `dot-bootstrap`: sets up local environment by executing all roles in `local_env.yml`.
- `dot-update`: updates local environment by executing all roles in `local_env.yml` except for the ones tagged with "bootstrap".

## special files

All configuration is done in `~/dotfiles`. Each role may contain (in addition to the typical ansible directories and files) a number of special files

- **role/\*.zsh**: Any files ending in `.zsh` get loaded into your environment.
- **bin/**: Anything in `bin/` will get added to your `$PATH` and be made available everywhere.

## notes

**vscode**

Use built-in Settings Sync to sync VSCode settings.

**macOS keyboard settings**

There are a few keyboard customizations that must be done manually:

- System Settings > Keyboard > Turn "Key repeat rate" and "Delay until repeat" to their highest settings.

![Keyboard settings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c0e9ed6-3e5b-4996-b1e0-4aa4e9de3725 "Key repeat settings")

- System Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Modifier Keys > Change Caps Lock key to Control.

**mac mini**

I also use this repo to configure my Mac Mini server which I have running in headless mode. My setup is documented in [docs/MAC_MINI.md](docs/MAC_MINI.md).

## what if I only want your vim?

First make sure you have a sane vim compiled. On macOS, the following will do:

```
brew install vim
```

The following commands will install vim-plug and download my `.vimrc`.

After backing up your `~/.vim` directory and `~/.vimrc`:

```
mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
curl -fLo ~/.vimrc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sloria/dotfiles/master/roles/vim/files/vimrc
```

You will now be able to open vim and run `:PlugInstall` to install all plugins.

## troubleshooting

If you get an error about Xcode command-line tools, you may need to run

```
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```
